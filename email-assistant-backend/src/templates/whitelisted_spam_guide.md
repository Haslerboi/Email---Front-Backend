# Whitelisted Spam Email Processing Guide

Emails categorized as "Whitelisted Spam" are from senders that have been manually marked as trusted but still contain promotional or non-essential content.

## Processing Notes

- These emails are from senders in the whitelist (managed through the 'white' folder)
- Emails are marked as read but remain in the inbox for visibility
- No draft replies are generated for whitelisted spam emails
- Business owner can still see these emails but they won't create notification noise

## Whitelist Management

- Senders are added to whitelist by placing their emails in the 'white' folder
- System automatically extracts sender addresses and adds them to the whitelist
- Future emails from whitelisted senders are categorized as "Whitelisted Spam"
- Whitelisted emails are processed but not moved to spam folders

If a draft reply is accidentally requested for a whitelisted spam email, respond with:

"Thank you for your message. This appears to be an informational or promotional email. If you need a specific response or have questions about our services, please let us know and we'll be happy to help."
