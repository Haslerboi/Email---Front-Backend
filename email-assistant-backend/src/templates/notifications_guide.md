# Notifications Processing Guide

Emails categorized as "Notifications" are automated system notifications from legitimate services that don't require immediate attention but should be organized for later review.

## Typical Notification Email Types

- App notifications (social media, software updates)
- Service notifications (cloud storage, hosting platforms)
- System alerts and status updates
- Automated reports and summaries
- Platform notifications (GitHub, Slack, Trello, etc.)
- Non-urgent automated messages
- Service uptime/downtime alerts
- Backup completion notifications

## Processing Notes

- These emails stay in the primary inbox for **5 minutes** for immediate visibility
- After 5 minutes, they are automatically moved to the "Notification" label/folder
- Emails are marked as read when moved to keep inbox clean
- Business owner can review Notification folder periodically
- Important notifications are visible initially but don't clutter long-term

## 5-Minute Delay Rationale

The 5-minute delay allows for:
- Quick visibility of important system alerts
- Time to see urgent notifications before they're filed
- Automatic organization without missing critical updates
- Clean inbox maintenance

If a draft reply is accidentally requested for a notification email, respond with:

"This appears to be an automated system notification that typically doesn't require a response. If this notification indicates an issue that needs attention or if you have questions about the service, please contact the relevant support team directly."
