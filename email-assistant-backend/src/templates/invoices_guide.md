Emails categorized as "Invoices" are typically billing-related communications that don't require responses. These emails should be moved to the Invoices folder for record-keeping and accounting purposes.

## Typical Invoice Email Types

- Vendor invoices and bills
- Service provider billing statements
- Subscription payment notifications
- Financial statements
- Tax-related documents
- Accounting software notifications

## Processing Notes

- These emails are automatically moved to the "Invoices" label/folder
- No draft replies are generated for invoice emails

If a draft reply is accidentally requested for an invoice email, respond with:

"Thank you for the invoice. This has been received and will be processed according to our standard accounting procedures. If you have any questions about payment or need additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out."
