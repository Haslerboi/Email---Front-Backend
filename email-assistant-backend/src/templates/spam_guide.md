# Spam Email Processing Guide

Emails categorized as "Spam" are unwanted promotional, marketing, or malicious emails that should be filtered out of the main inbox.

## Typical Spam Email Types

- Promotional marketing emails
- Newsletter subscriptions
- Automated notifications from apps/services
- Phishing attempts
- Mass marketing campaigns
- Unsubscribe confirmations
- System notifications that don't require action

## Processing Notes

- These emails are automatically moved to the "Email Prison" label/folder
- Emails are marked as read to prevent notification noise
- No draft replies are generated for spam emails
- Business owner can review Email Prison folder if needed

If a draft reply is accidentally requested for a spam email, respond with:

"This appears to be an automated or promotional email that doesn't require a response. If this was sent in error and you need assistance, please contact us directly through our official business channels."
